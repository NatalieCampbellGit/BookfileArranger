  # 📕 Professional README Generator 

  ## 📃 Description
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. This generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.

  # Installation 
  📝 
  I can  enter my text or copy and paste. Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
  
  # Usage
  ⚡
  I can type or paste . Answer the questions as they are asked. Most questions require your input while some are a list option to choose from. Follow the prompts. 
  
  # Contributing
  🏗️ 
  I can type or paste. State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them. For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self. You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
  
  # Tests
  🏆 
  I can type or paste. The first sentence is often the most difficult one for a lot of writers when they sit down to write.
